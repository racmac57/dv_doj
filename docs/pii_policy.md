# PII Handling Policy

- No personally identifiable information (PII) is committed to this repository.
- Raw source data remains on secured local storage (`raw_data/`) and is excluded from version control.
- Before sharing extracts, redact names, dates of birth, phone numbers, licence plates, addresses, and any unique identifiers.
- QA outputs must be scrubbed of PII prior to distribution. Retain only aggregated metrics or anonymised samples.
- Access to production data should follow City of Hackensack governance and auditing requirements.
