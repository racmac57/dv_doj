Upon our arrival the exterior was checked and appeared secure. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"   On January 1, 2023 at approximately 0227 hours, while patrolling the area of Veterans Park I observed the patient, Darlene Bomnam, sleeping on a park bench. I spoke with the patient who appeared to have vomited on herself. The patient was slurring her words and had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath. She reported that she had been drinking earlier in the day. I advised communications. P.O. Rios responded to assist. Hackensack Volunteer Ambulance responded and transported the patient to Hackensack University Medical Center, as per A.T.R.A guidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"P.O. Koenig and I responded to Union Avenue Park on a report of a female crying and possibly had just been assaulted.  I located a female who flagged me down in front of 121 Myer Street.  The victim, Jenniffer Martinez, explained that her boyfriend, the arrestee, has been assaulting her for the last 7 months and she has to report it the police.  I asked her what happened today and she stated he strangled her neck with his hand to the point where she felt like she could not breathe for approximately 3 seconds.  The arrestee, Bryan Sinchi-Caldas, then walked by and was detained.  He spoke only Spanish so P.O. Caero responded to translate.  \\n\\nThe victim explained that earlier in the day, at approximately 17:30 hours, in her apartment located at \\n55 Manor Drive, Apartment 4L, Newark, NJ, the arrestee had gotten jealous when he found her divorce papers from a previous relationship.  A verbal argument turned verbally abusive resulting in the victim crying and attempting to leave her apartment.  The arrestee grabbed her by the hair and threw her to the floor.  He slapped her several times in the face with an open hand and strangled her with one hand resulting in her not being able to breathe.  The assault ended and later that evening, at approximately 23:00 hours, they both arrived at 102 Sussex Street, 5th Floor, Unknown Apartment, Hackensack NJ to attend a New Years Eve party with the arrestee's Aunt and Uncle.  The Aunt and Uncle do not live there and it is not known where they live.\\n\\nWhile at the party, the arrestee continued to verbally abuse the victim which resulted in her telling the Aunt and Uncle of the abuse which made the arrestee verbally abuse her even more.  She fled the apartment and ran down the stairs but the arrestee grabbed her arm on the stairs and prevented her from leaving.  He positioned himself so the victim could not go down the stairs any further.  He then forcibly removed the victim's cellphone from her hand by grabbing her arm and shoving her.  He told her she could not leave, threw the phone on the ground and stepped on it.  The phone was not damaged.  The Aunt followed the victim and arrestee down the stairs and interrupted him long enough for the victim to get her phone and flee the building.  She then went to Union Street Park where a passerby called the police.\\n\\nThe victim was not injured and did not want medical attention.    \\n\\nThe arrestee stated they were just arguing and nothing happened. \\n\\nThe arrestee was placed under arrest for allegations of robbery and false imprisonment.  See additional charges for another aggravated assault that took place on 12/21/22, reference case 23-000084.  He was handcuffed with his hands behind his back, searched incident to arrest and placed in the rear of radio car 112 with the vehicle camera turned on.  He was transported to Headquarters for processing.  P.O. Koenig followed behind in radio car 138 while transporting the victim for application of a temporary restraining order.  At headquarters he was searched again with negative results.\\n\\nDetective Antista took a recorded statement from the victim.  \\n\\nA victim notification form was completed and a copy was provided to the victim.  The victim did not want to speak to a domestic violence counselor at this time, but I provided her with the phone number for future use.  She did not want to provide a written statement.  \\n\\nODARA was completed.  \\n\\nThe victim was granted a temporary restraining order by the Honorable Judge Takvorian.  Both \\nthe victim and arrestee were served with their copy of the TRO.  \\n\\nSgt. Briggs prepared complaint #0223W2023-2 on my behalf against the arrestee for violations of 2C:15-1a, 2C:20-3, 2C:12-1a(1), and 2C:13-3.  \\n\\nThe defendant was processed and remanded to the Bergen County Jail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"      I responded to the listed location on report of a noise complaint from a vehicle. As I was driving up Colonial Terrace looking for the described vehicle (dark vehicle behind a white Jeep), I could hear excessive music in the area. I located the described vehicle in front of 468 Colonial Terrace and observed it to be going off.  I also determined that address to be the source of the excessive noise. \\n      I noticed several other cars in the area of 468 Colonial Terrace and in a dual purpose to first, locate the vehicle's owner and turn off the alarm and second, to advise the resident to lower the music I approached the front door. I knocked on the door for several minutes attempting to raise a  \\nresident about the vehicle's alarm and the noise. Finally, the intoxicated resident (hereafter referred to as suspect) came to the door\\n\\n     I informed the suspect that I was audio and video recording and needed him to turn down the music. I also requested his identification and advised him if officers had to return to his residence for music that he could be subject to a city ordinance violation. The suspect informed me that he wasn't required to give me any identification because he was in his own house. In an attempt to deescalate, I made attempts to explain to the suspect that the noise was against a city ordinance, that if officers didn't return he would not receive a summons but he was required to identify himself to me however, he again refused to provide identification. Using my MVC I ran the registrations of the vehicles in the driveway of that residence and was able to identify the suspect and asked for another officer to respond. P.O. Rios responded to assist. \\n\\n     I then issued city ordinance for violation of 112-5a Prohibited acts by means of noise disturbance. \\n\\n     The owner of vehicle one was located at the residence and was advised to make sure their alarm stopped going off. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"   On January 1, 2023 at approximately 0322 hours P.O. Koenig, P.O. Farhi, and I responded to 74 Lodi Street on a reported suspicious incident. I spoke with the complainant, Julio Molina, who reported he saw a person walking with a bat. P.O. Koenig and P.O. Farhi responded to assist. I spoke with Adam Zepeda and Jolanda Penolo who reported that Jolanda Penolo's boyfriend, Matia Veloz, had became jealous of Adam Zepeda's friendship with Jolanda Penolo. A verbal argument occurred between Matia Veloz and Adam Zepeda's resulting in Veloz grabbing a bat. Adam Zepeda ran out of the residence. I asked Adam Zepeda and Jolanda Penolo if they were assaulted by Matia Veloz and they replied, \\\"No.\\\" Both of them reported it was just a verbal argument and they did not want to report anything.\\n     No parties reported that there was any physical altercation, just a verbal dispute between Matia Veloz and Adam Zepeda. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"     EN ROUTE AND OPERATION: On January 1, 2022, P.O. Koenig and I responded to the area of 276 Passaic Street on a report of a motor vehicle accident involving a vehicle into a fire hydrant. I was the first officer on scene, and upon arrival I immediately observed multiple people standing outside on the sidewalk in front of 276 Passaic Street. I also observed a red fire hydrant damaged and knocked over, exposing a large open hole in the grass and heavy water flow emanating from the large hole. I advised Headquarters of my findings and the Hackensack Fire Department was dispatched to the area. \\n    \\n      I approached the multiple people on the scene, whom were all advising me that a vehicle struck \\n     \\nthe fire hydrant and immediately fled the scene West on Passaic Street and made a right turn North on Franklin Place. One of the witnesses, Digna Guaman, described the vehicle as a small white car with heavy front end damages and stated that the neighbors ran after the vehicle attempting to stop it. An unknown neighbor approached me thereafter and showed me a picture of the license plate he captured, NJ-T12RAA, which was captured on my body camera and matched the description provided by Digna Guaman. I was also advised that the suspect vehicle was last observed making a right turn onto Hamilton Place. I advised P.O. Koenig to check the reported areas the suspect vehicle was last observed. \\n    \\n      Digna Guaman advised me that her and other residents heard a loud sound emanate from outside and responded outside. Upon responding outside, her and other local residents observed the fire hydrant heavily damaged and the suspect vehicle stopped in the street appearing to have heavy front end damages. The vehicle then quickly fled the scene when her and other residents tried approaching the vehicle. \\n     \\n     The Hackensack Fire Department responded on scene. I advised the firefighters on scene what reportedly occurred causing damages to the fire hydrant. I also advised them the vehicle was a white colored Nissan Sentra. A firefighter advised me that while en route to the scene they observed a white colored Nissan Sentra with heavy front end damages, along with a Hispanic-looking male standing outside of the vehicle, with the vehicle parked in the area of of 137 Clinton Place. I provided the information to P.O. Koenig over the air and requested that he search that area. \\n\\n     P.O. Koenig advised over the air that he located NJ-T12RAA, a white colored Nissan Sentra, parked on Clinton Place and occupied. P.O. Farhi responded to assist P.O. Koenig. I responded to the scene an I observed P.O. Koenig and P.O. Farhi standing by next to NJ-T12RAA. The vehicle was parked in front of 145 Clinton Place in a No Parking Anytime zone. As  I approached the vehicle I observed what appeared to be a piece of a white bumper in the rear seat of the vehicle and heavy damages to the front end of the vehicle. I observed the arrestee, David Yumba Inga, sitting in the driver seat of the vehicle. As I approached the driver door of the vehicle, the window was rolled down and I observed the arrestee's eyes to be bloodshot. I asked the driver if he was the one driving the vehicle, which he confirmed he was, and I requested his driver's license, registration, and insurance. ***Driver/arrestee was both English and Spanish speaking, to which I communicated in both languages during my investigation***\\n     \\n     The driver advised me that his license and proof of insurance was in a backpack in the rear seat of the vehicle. As I he spoke I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage, which seemed to also be masked by a minty \\\"listerine like\\\" odor consistent with chewing gums. As the driver exited the vehicle, he was over-talkative and polite, and I immediately observed an empty bottle of Golden Monkey brand beer, an alcoholic beverage I am familiar with and is brewed by Victory Brewing, located near the foot area of the driver seat. I also observed \\nmultiple small empty \\\"shooter style\\\" clear bottles with a green label. P.O. Farhi also advised of the Golden Monkey brand beer bottle he observed in plain view. P.O. Farhi left the scene shortly after and responded to the area of 276 Passaic Street, to stand by the damaged fire hydrant with the Hackensack Fire Department. \\n\\n     The arrestee retrieved his driver's license and proof of insurance, and I advised him that I still required his vehicle registration card. The arrestee had to re enter the vehicle to retrieve his vehicle registration card. He entered via the driver door due to the front passenger door being unable to open due to heavy damaged. Once the arrestee provided his registration card I requested he exit the vehicle. I asked the arrestee if he recalls how his vehicle was damaged and he reported that while traveling on Passaic Street, he was briefly blinded by the high beams of an oncoming vehicle, which caused him to veer off the road. I asked if he recalled what his vehicle struck and he reported his vehicle struck a fire hydrant. I asked the arrestee why he left the scene, to which he uttered his car was damaged and he needed to get home. \\n\\n     I advised the arrestee I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage on his person, and asked him if he consumed any alcoholic beverages this evening. He reported he consumed 3 beers this evening and his last drink was within the hour. When asked, he confirmed the beers he drank were Golden Monkey beers. The arrestee reported drinking no other types of alcoholic beverages, \\n    \\n     Based on the motor vehicle collision into a fire hydrant, fleeing the scene, the odor of an alcoholic beverage on the arrestee's person, the odor of an alcoholic beverage masking agent in suspected chewing gum, the admission of consuming beers with a higher than average alcohol by volume percentage, the observed empty alcoholic beverage containers in plain view within the vehicle, I requested the arrestee to complete Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. \\n\\n     STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTING: I asked the arrestee if he was willing and able to completed Standardized Field Sobriety testing, to which he confirmed he was willing and able to. Prior to conducting testing I asked the arrestee if he had any injuries of physical ailments, to include diabetes, which would prevent him from completing the testing. He confirmed he suffered from no injuries, ailments, or medical conditions which would prevent him completing Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. He only reported his knees make a clicking sound when he squats deeply.\\n\\n    While P.O. Koenig stood by with the arrestee, I repositioned Radio Car #119 to face South into the middle driveway of 145 Clinton Place. The middle driveway of 145 Clinton Place is in the middle of the apartment complex, leveled, well lit, and is used for access to the private single car garages. Radio Car #119 overhead lights and emergency lights were not activated during testing, and the testing ground was level, flat, and free of debris. \\n\\n    I guided the arrestee over to the testing ground and advised him that the two tests that would be conducted and the first one would be the Walk and Turn testing. I asked if he was familiar with the Walk and Turn testing, which he confirmed he was familiar with. I advised the arrestee I would demonstrate the test prior to placing himself in the starting position and beginning the test. I demonstrated the test to him and asked if he understood what to do for the test and what the starting position was. I also advised he needed to count his steps out loud, which he confirmed he understood. While in the starting position, the arrestee was unable to keep his right heel directly in front of his left toe with appearing to sway. After advising the arrestee to begin, he was unable to maintain heel to toe steps and was observed to sway and hold his arms wide for balance. He took 12 in the first half and 14 in the second half. He failed the Walk and Turn test based on my observations. \\n\\n     I advised the arrestee that the next exam was the One Leg Stand test. I advised the arrestee of the starting position and that he may choose whichever foot he wants to keep approximately 6 inches off of the ground. I explained he needed to also keep his hands to his sides and provide a 30 count in the following format, one- one hundred, two -one hundred, 3- one hundred, and so on. Once the arrestee began the test, I observed him to sway and use his arms for balance. He counted up to 50 in the incorrect format as well after he confirmed he understood all instructions and after I demonstrated. The arrestee failed the One Leg Stand Test based on my observations. \\n\\n     The arrestee was handcuffed behind his back, arrested for suspicion of driving while intoxicated. He was searched and placed in the rear of Radio Car #119. No contraband was located on the arrestee. I searched NJ-T12RAA for evidence of intoxicants, in plain view  on the driver side floor, passenger side floor, I observed multiple empty beer bottles of Golden Monkey beer, and numerous empty \\\"shooter size\\\" bottles of New Amsterdam Vodka. I also observed an open case of chewing gum, black box with green individually wrapped gum on the driver seat. \\nI advised Headquarters to have a wrecker respond to impound the vehicle as per John's Law. \\n\\n     P.O. Dogali responded on scene to standby for Polifly Towing. I transported the arrestee to Hackensack Police Headquarters, while P.O. Koenig assisted by following in Radio Car #138. The arrestee and the rear of Radio Car #119 was searched once more upon arrival to Headquarters, which yielded negative results for contraband. \\n    \\n     AT HEADQUARTERS: The arrestee was placed in Report Room #2. He was searched. The arrestee's observation period began at approximately 0430 hours. My body camera remained activated during this time period. The arrestee was read the New Jersey Attorney General's Standard Statement for Motor Vehicle Operation, which he responded Yes for understanding and agreeing. The arrestee was was read and provided a copy of his Miranda Warning in Spanish, which he read, answered yes,  initialed and signed. I also signed the form. DWI forms were completed.\\n     See DWI Report.\\n     See DWI Questionnaire.\\n     See DWI Last Drink Location Report.\\n     See DWI Implied Consent Form.\\n\\n     P.O. Kiselow conducted the AlCOTEST on the arrestee, and the arrestee's B.A.C. was 0.15%. The arrestee was provided a copy of his ALCOTEST results. \\n    See P.O. Kiselow's supplement. \\n\\n    I photographed the arrestee.\\n\\n    Yenny M. Angel Hernandez was contacted to take custody of the arrestee. She responded to Headquarters and provided identification. The Potential Liability Warning Form was completed and signed by Yenny M. Angel Hernandez. She was explained the form and provided with the original copy. The arrestee was turned over to Yenny M. Angel Hernandez and approximately 0638 hours.\\n\\n     See Arrest Report. \\n\\n\\n      The following summonses were issued to the arrestee:\\n\\n     E23-000001 for violation of 39:4-50\\n     E23-000002 for violation of 39:4-96\\n     E23-000003 for violation of 39:4-130\\n     E23-000004 for violation of 39:4-129B\\n     E23-000005 for violation of 39:4-51A.B\\n     E23-000006 for violation of 170-7\\n\\n\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"    On January 1, 2023 at approximately 0404 hours I responded to Johnson Avenue and Zabriskie Street on a reported motor vehicle crash. Upon arrival, vehicle 1 had left the scene of the crash and a city directional sign was laying on the ground on Johnson Avenue. I spoke with the complainant, Justin Nikoloski, who reported that he was at 188 Johnson Avenue when he saw a black colored vehicle crash into the city sign while traveling North on Johnson Avenue. After the crash the complainant reported vehicle 1 continued North on Johnson Avenue. A black bumper was laying on the ground on Johnson Avenue where the incident occurred. P.O. Dogali responded to assist. 8 photographs were taken of the incident with the backup patrol camera.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n      \"On 01/01/2023, I was assigned to perform the alcotest on Mr. David Yumbla Inga, the arrestee.   P.O. Rios checked the arrestee's mouth for any foreign objects with negative results.  At 0430 hours, the minimum twenty minute observation period began.  During this time, the arrestee did not belch, cough, or have any bodily function that would compromise the alcotest.  At the completion of the 20 minute observation period, the arrestee was brought to the testing room.  All electronic equipment and contents within the arrestee's pockets were secured prior to entering the testing room.  I also secured my cellular phone  prior to entering the testing room. The room was clear of all electronic equipment (ie. cellular phones, portable radios). The arrestee was read the standard breath sample instructions.  A new mouthpiece was attached to the machine and a first breath sample was \\nprovided, which yielded minimum volume not achieved, as the arrestee was sucking in, instead of blowing out.  The mouthpiece was changed and the instructions were again read and a second breath sample was provided which again yielded minimum volume not achieved.  Again the arrestee was sucking in instead of blowing out.  The mouthpiece was changed and the instructions were read again in English and Spanish (by P.O. Rios).  A third breath sample was provided which yielded Blowing not Allowed.  A fourth breath sample was provided by the arrestee.  Again the mouthpiece was changed and the instructions were read to the arrestee.  The fourth breath sample yielded Blowing not allowed.  A new mouthpiece was changed and a fifth breath sample was provided by the arrestee which yielded minimum volume not achieved. The arrestee was again read the instructions in Spanish and English.  A mouthpiece was changed and a sixth breath test was provided by the  arrestee which yielded a result of .15% BAC.  The mouthpiece was changed again and the arrestee provided his final breath sample which yielded a result of .15% BAC. After the testing was complete, the arrestee was turned over to Officer Rios.  The results were entered into the State of New Jersey Alcotest calculator which deemed the results were within acceptable tolerance.  A signed copy of the results were given to the arrestee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 47949\n  },\n  \"Total Value Stolen\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"float64\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 78,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"4809.0\",\n      \"991.68\",\n      \"900.0\",\n      \"0.16\",\n      \"800.0\",\n      \"110.7\",\n      \"139.91\",\n      \"219.98\",\n      \"10000.0\",\n      \"47000.0\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 70\n  },\n  \"Total Value Recover\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"float64\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 9,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"3000.0\",\n      \"0.0\",\n      \"3.09\",\n      \"0.0\",\n      \"0.0\",\n      \"43.3\",\n      \"0.0\",\n      \"0.0\",\n      \"0.0\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 4\n  },\n  \"Registration 1\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 15834,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"x77pel\",\n      \"t12raa\",\n      \"unknown\",\n      \"n49gdh\",\n      \"UNKNOWn\",\n      \"rze2366\",\n      \"Y64NTU\",\n      \"505463t\",\n      \"9GWH90\",\n      \"j58erj\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 14069\n  },\n  \"Make1\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 15578,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"V W\",\n      \"NIS\",\n      \"MIT\",\n      \"Ford\",\n      \"V W\",\n      \"Mercedes\",\n      \"Hyundai\",\n      \"TOY\",\n      \"JEEP\",\n      \"Hyundai\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 392\n  },\n  \"Model1\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 15534,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"JET\",\n      \"SEN\",\n      \"OUT\",\n      \"focus\",\n      \"PAS\",\n      \"350\",\n      \"Tucson\",\n      \"SIE\",\n      \"CHEROKEE\",\n      \"Ela\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 1880\n  },\n  \"Reg State 1\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 15731,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"GA\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"MA\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NY\",\n      \"nj\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 138\n  },\n  \"Registration 2\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 6678,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"7ev7811\",\n      \"KXM8110\",\n      \"3160159\",\n      \"XJDC53\",\n      \"y12gba\",\n      \"z68jkz\",\n      \"F64PTP\",\n      \"b16pjy\",\n      \"unknown\",\n      \"b96rrv\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 6290\n  },\n  \"Reg State 2\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 6456,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"MD\",\n      \"NY\",\n      \"in\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"nj\",\n      \"NJ\",\n      \"NJ\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 86\n  },\n  \"Make2\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 6550,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"Toyota\",\n      \"Kia\",\n      \"FRT\",\n      \"MAC\",\n      \"HON\",\n      \"HONDA\",\n      \"HON\",\n      \"Toyota\",\n      \"INF\",\n      \"HON\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 276\n  },\n  \"Model2\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 6446,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"Camry\",\n      \"Telluride\",\n      \"TE6\",\n      \"CRV\",\n      \"CRV\",\n      \"HRV\",\n      \"CHR\",\n      \"G35\",\n      \"CRV\",\n      \"RAV\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 1179\n  },\n  \"Reviewed By\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 54282,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"134\",\n      \"158\",\n      \"273\",\n      \"160\",\n      \"273\",\n      \"160\",\n      \"162\",\n      \"273\",\n      \"273\",\n      \"273\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 98\n  },\n  \"CompleteCalc\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 54370,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\",\n      \"Complete\"\n    ],\n    \"unique_values_count\": 2\n  },\n  \"Officer of Record\": {\n    \"dtype\": \"object\",\n    \"non_null_count\": 54369,\n    \"sample_values\": [\n      \"Det.

I spoke with the patient who appeared to have vomited on herself. The patient was slurring her words and had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath. She reported that she had been drinking earlier in the day. I advised communications. P.O. Rios responded to assist.

          "P.O. Koenig and I responded to Union Avenue Park on a report of a female crying and possibly had just been assaulted.  I located a female who flagged me down in front of 121 Myer Street.  The victim, Jenniffer Martinez, explained that her boyfriend, the arrestee, has been assaulting her for the last 7 months and she has to report it the police.  I asked her what happened today and she stated he strangled her neck with his hand to the point where she felt like she could not breathe for approximately 3 seconds.  The arrestee, Bryan Sinchi-Caldas, then walked by and was detained.  He spoke only Spanish so P.O. Caero responded to translate.  \n\nThe victim explained that earlier in the day, at approximately 17:30 hours, in her apartment located at \n55 Manor Drive, Apartment 4L, Newark, NJ, the arrestee had gotten jealous when he found her divorce papers from a previous relationship.  A verbal argument turned verbally abusive resulting in the victim crying and attempting to leave her apartment.  The arrestee grabbed her by the hair and threw her to the floor.  He slapped her several times in the face with an open hand and strangled her with one hand resulting in her not being able to breathe.  The assault ended and later that evening, at approximately 23:00 hours, they both arrived at 102 Sussex Street, 5th Floor, Unknown Apartment, Hackensack NJ to attend a New Years Eve party with the arrestee's Aunt and Uncle.  The Aunt and Uncle do not live there and it is not known where they live.\n\nWhile at the party, the arrestee continued to verbally abuse the victim which resulted in her telling the Aunt and Uncle of the abuse which made the arrestee verbally abuse her even more.  She fled the apartment and ran down the stairs but the arrestee grabbed her arm on the stairs and prevented her from leaving.  He positioned himself so the victim could not go down the stairs any further.  He then forcibly removed the victim's cellphone from her hand by grabbing her arm and shoving her.  He told her she could not leave, threw the phone on the ground and stepped on it.  The phone was not damaged.  The Aunt followed the victim and arrestee down the stairs and interrupted him long enough for the victim to get her phone and flee the building.  She then went to Union Street Park where a passerby called the police.\n\nThe victim was not injured and did not want medical attention.    \n\nThe arrestee stated they were just arguing and nothing happened. \n\nThe arrestee was placed under arrest for allegations of robbery and false imprisonment.  See additional charges for another aggravated assault that took place on 12/21/22, reference case 23-000084.  He was handcuffed with his hands behind his back, searched incident to arrest and placed in the rear of radio car 112 with the vehicle camera turned on.  He was transported to Headquarters for processing.  P.O. Koenig followed behind in radio car 138 while transporting the victim for application of a temporary restraining order.  At headquarters he was searched again with negative results.\n\nDetective Antista took a recorded statement from the victim.  \n\nA victim notification form was completed and a copy was provided to the victim.  The victim did not want to speak to a domestic violence counselor at this time, but I provided her with the phone number for future use.  She did not want to provide a written statement.  \n\nODARA was completed.  \n\nThe victim was granted a temporary restraining order by the Honorable Judge Takvorian.  Both \nthe victim and arrestee were served with their copy of the TRO.  \n\nSgt. Briggs prepared complaint #0223W2023-2 on my behalf against the arrestee for violations of 2C:15-1a, 2C:20-3, 2C:12-1a(1), and 2C:13-3.  \n\nThe defendant was processed and remanded to the Bergen County Jail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "      I responded to the listed location on report of a noise complaint from a vehicle. As I was driving up Colonial Terrace looking for the described vehicle (dark vehicle behind a white Jeep), I could hear excessive music in the area. I located the described vehicle in front of 468 Colonial Terrace and observed it to be going off.  I also determined that address to be the source of the excessive noise. \n      I noticed several other cars in the area of 468 Colonial Terrace and in a dual purpose to first, locate the vehicle's owner and turn off the alarm and second, to advise the resident to lower the music I approached the front door. I knocked on the door for several minutes attempting to raise a  \nresident about the vehicle's alarm and the noise. Finally, the intoxicated resident (hereafter referred to as suspect) came to the door\n\n     I informed the suspect that I was audio and video recording and needed him to turn down the music. I also requested his identification and advised him if officers had to return to his residence for music that he could be subject to a city ordinance violation. The suspect informed me that he wasn't required to give me any identification because he was in his own house. In an attempt to deescalate, I made attempts to explain to the suspect that the noise was against a city ordinance, that if officers didn't return he would not receive a summons but he was required to identify himself to me however, he again refused to provide identification. Using my MVC I ran the registrations of the vehicles in the driveway of that residence and was able to identify the suspect and asked for another officer to respond. P.O. Rios responded to assist. \n\n     I then issued city ordinance for violation of 112-5a Prohibited acts by means of noise disturbance. \n\n     The owner of vehicle one was located at the residence and was advised to make sure their alarm stopped going off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "   On January 1, 2023 at approximately 0322 hours P.O. Koenig, P.O. Farhi, and I responded to 74 Lodi Street on a reported suspicious incident. I spoke with the complainant, Julio Molina, who reported he saw a person walking with a bat. P.O. Koenig and P.O. Farhi responded to assist. I spoke with Adam Zepeda and Jolanda Penolo who reported that Jolanda Penolo's boyfriend, Matia Veloz, had became jealous of Adam Zepeda's friendship with Jolanda Penolo. A verbal argument occurred between Matia Veloz and Adam Zepeda's resulting in Veloz grabbing a bat. Adam Zepeda ran out of the residence. I asked Adam Zepeda and Jolanda Penolo if they were assaulted by Matia Veloz and they replied, \"No.\" Both of them reported it was just a verbal argument and they did not want to report anything.\n     No parties reported that there was any physical altercation, just a verbal dispute between Matia Veloz and Adam Zepeda. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "     EN ROUTE AND OPERATION: On January 1, 2022, P.O. Koenig and I responded to the area of 276 Passaic Street on a report of a motor vehicle accident involving a vehicle into a fire hydrant. I was the first officer on scene, and upon arrival I immediately observed multiple people standing outside on the sidewalk in front of 276 Passaic Street. I also observed a red fire hydrant damaged and knocked over, exposing a large open hole in the grass and heavy water flow emanating from the large hole. I advised Headquarters of my findings and the Hackensack Fire Department was dispatched to the area. \n    \n      I approached the multiple people on the scene, whom were all advising me that a vehicle struck \n     \nthe fire hydrant and immediately fled the scene West on Passaic Street and made a right turn North on Franklin Place. One of the witnesses, Digna Guaman, described the vehicle as a small white car with heavy front end damages and stated that the neighbors ran after the vehicle attempting to stop it. An unknown neighbor approached me thereafter and showed me a picture of the license plate he captured, NJ-T12RAA, which was captured on my body camera and matched the description provided by Digna Guaman. I was also advised that the suspect vehicle was last observed making a right turn onto Hamilton Place. I advised P.O. Koenig to check the reported areas the suspect vehicle was last observed. \n    \n      Digna Guaman advised me that her and other residents heard a loud sound emanate from outside and responded outside. Upon responding outside, her and other local residents observed the fire hydrant heavily damaged and the suspect vehicle stopped in the street appearing to have heavy front end damages. The vehicle then quickly fled the scene when her and other residents tried approaching the vehicle. \n     \n     The Hackensack Fire Department responded on scene. I advised the firefighters on scene what reportedly occurred causing damages to the fire hydrant. I also advised them the vehicle was a white colored Nissan Sentra. A firefighter advised me that while en route to the scene they observed a white colored Nissan Sentra with heavy front end damages, along with a Hispanic-looking male standing outside of the vehicle, with the vehicle parked in the area of of 137 Clinton Place. I provided the information to P.O. Koenig over the air and requested that he search that area. \n\n     P.O. Koenig advised over the air that he located NJ-T12RAA, a white colored Nissan Sentra, parked on Clinton Place and occupied. P.O. Farhi responded to assist P.O. Koenig. I responded to the scene an I observed P.O. Koenig and P.O. Farhi standing by next to NJ-T12RAA. The vehicle was parked in front of 145 Clinton Place in a No Parking Anytime zone. As  I approached the vehicle I observed what appeared to be a piece of a white bumper in the rear seat of the vehicle and heavy damages to the front end of the vehicle. I observed the arrestee, David Yumba Inga, sitting in the driver seat of the vehicle. As I approached the driver door of the vehicle, the window was rolled down and I observed the arrestee's eyes to be bloodshot. I asked the driver if he was the one driving the vehicle, which he confirmed he was, and I requested his driver's license, registration, and insurance. ***Driver/arrestee was both English and Spanish speaking, to which I communicated in both languages during my investigation***\n     \n     The driver advised me that his license and proof of insurance was in a backpack in the rear seat of the vehicle. As I he spoke I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage, which seemed to also be masked by a minty \"listerine like\" odor consistent with chewing gums. As the driver exited the vehicle, he was over-talkative and polite, and I immediately observed an empty bottle of Golden Monkey brand beer, an alcoholic beverage I am familiar with and is brewed by Victory Brewing, located near the foot area of the driver seat. I also observed \nmultiple small empty \"shooter style\" clear bottles with a green label. P.O. Farhi also advised of the Golden Monkey brand beer bottle he observed in plain view. P.O. Farhi left the scene shortly after and responded to the area of 276 Passaic Street, to stand by the damaged fire hydrant with the Hackensack Fire Department. \n\n     The arrestee retrieved his driver's license and proof of insurance, and I advised him that I still required his vehicle registration card. The arrestee had to re enter the vehicle to retrieve his vehicle registration card. He entered via the driver door due to the front passenger door being unable to open due to heavy damaged. Once the arrestee provided his registration card I requested he exit the vehicle. I asked the arrestee if he recalls how his vehicle was damaged and he reported that while traveling on Passaic Street, he was briefly blinded by the high beams of an oncoming vehicle, which caused him to veer off the road. I asked if he recalled what his vehicle struck and he reported his vehicle struck a fire hydrant. I asked the arrestee why he left the scene, to which he uttered his car was damaged and he needed to get home. \n\n     I advised the arrestee I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage on his person, and asked him if he consumed any alcoholic beverages this evening. He reported he consumed 3 beers this evening and his last drink was within the hour. When asked, he confirmed the beers he drank were Golden Monkey beers. The arrestee reported drinking no other types of alcoholic beverages, \n    \n     Based on the motor vehicle collision into a fire hydrant, fleeing the scene, the odor of an alcoholic beverage on the arrestee's person, the odor of an alcoholic beverage masking agent in suspected chewing gum, the admission of consuming beers with a higher than average alcohol by volume percentage, the observed empty alcoholic beverage containers in plain view within the vehicle, I requested the arrestee to complete Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. \n\n     STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTING: I asked the arrestee if he was willing and able to completed Standardized Field Sobriety testing, to which he confirmed he was willing and able to. Prior to conducting testing I asked the arrestee if he had any injuries of physical ailments, to include diabetes, which would prevent him from completing the testing. He confirmed he suffered from no injuries, ailments, or medical conditions which would prevent him completing Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. He only reported his knees make a clicking sound when he squats deeply.\n\n    While P.O. Koenig stood by with the arrestee, I repositioned Radio Car #119 to face South into the middle driveway of 145 Clinton Place. The middle driveway of 145 Clinton Place is in the middle of the apartment complex, leveled, well lit, and is used for access to the private single car garages. Radio Car #119 overhead lights and emergency lights were not activated during testing, and the testing ground was level, flat, and free of debris. \n\n    I guided the arrestee over to the testing ground and advised him that the two tests that would be conducted and the first one would be the Walk and Turn testing. I asked if he was familiar with the Walk and Turn testing, which he confirmed he was familiar with. I advised the arrestee I would demonstrate the test prior to placing himself in the starting position and beginning the test. I demonstrated the test to him and asked if he understood what to do for the test and what the starting position was. I also advised he needed to count his steps out loud, which he confirmed he understood. While in the starting position, the arrestee was unable to keep his right heel directly in front of his left toe with appearing to sway. After advising the arrestee to begin, he was unable to maintain heel to toe steps and was observed to sway and hold his arms wide for balance. He took 12 in the first half and 14 in the second half. He failed the Walk and Turn test based on my observations. \n\n     I advised the arrestee that the next exam was the One Leg Stand test. I advised the arrestee of the starting position and that he may choose whichever foot he wants to keep approximately 6 inches off of the ground. I explained he needed to also keep his hands to his sides and provide a 30 count in the following format, one- one hundred, two -one hundred, 3- one hundred, and so on. Once the arrestee began the test, I observed him to sway and use his arms for balance. He counted up to 50 in the incorrect format as well after he confirmed he understood all instructions and after I demonstrated. The arrestee failed the One Leg Stand Test based on my observations. \n\n     The arrestee was handcuffed behind his back, arrested for suspicion of driving while intoxicated. He was searched and placed in the rear of Radio Car #119. No contraband was located on the arrestee. I searched NJ-T12RAA for evidence of intoxicants, in plain view  on the driver side floor, passenger side floor, I observed multiple empty beer bottles of Golden Monkey beer, and numerous empty \"shooter size\" bottles of New Amsterdam Vodka. I also observed an open case of chewing gum, black box with green individually wrapped gum on the driver seat. \nI advised Headquarters to have a wrecker respond to impound the vehicle as per John's Law. \n\n     P.O. Dogali responded on scene to standby for Polifly Towing. I transported the arrestee to Hackensack Police Headquarters, while P.O. Koenig assisted by following in Radio Car #138. The arrestee and the rear of Radio Car #119 was searched once more upon arrival to Headquarters, which yielded negative results for contraband. \n    \n     AT HEADQUARTERS: The arrestee was placed in Report Room #2. He was searched. The arrestee's observation period began at approximately 0430 hours. My body camera remained activated during this time period. The arrestee was read the New Jersey Attorney General's Standard Statement for Motor Vehicle Operation, which he responded Yes for understanding and agreeing. The arrestee was was read and provided a copy of his Miranda Warning in Spanish, which he read, answered yes,  initialed and signed. I also signed the form. DWI forms were completed.\n     See DWI Report.\n     See DWI Questionnaire.\n     See DWI Last Drink Location Report.\n     See DWI Implied Consent Form.\n\n     P.O. Kiselow conducted the AlCOTEST on the arrestee, and the arrestee's B.A.C. was 0.15%. The arrestee was provided a copy of his ALCOTEST results. \n    See P.O. Kiselow's supplement. \n\n    I photographed the arrestee.\n\n    Yenny M. Angel Hernandez was contacted to take custody of the arrestee. She responded to Headquarters and provided identification. The Potential Liability Warning Form was completed and signed by Yenny M. Angel Hernandez. She was explained the form and provided with the original copy. The arrestee was turned over to Yenny M. Angel Hernandez and approximately 0638 hours.\n\n     See Arrest Report. \n\n\n      The following summonses were issued to the arrestee:\n\n     E23-000001 for violation of 39:4-50\n     E23-000002 for violation of 39:4-96\n     E23-000003 for violation of 39:4-130\n     E23-000004 for violation of 39:4-129B\n     E23-000005 for violation of 39:4-51A.B\n     E23-000006 for violation of 170-7\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "    On January 1, 2023 at approximately 0404 hours I responded to Johnson Avenue and Zabriskie Street on a reported motor vehicle crash. Upon arrival, vehicle 1 had left the scene of the crash and a city directional sign was laying on the ground on Johnson Avenue. I spoke with the complainant, Justin Nikoloski, who reported that he was at 188 Johnson Avenue when he saw a black colored vehicle crash into the city sign while traveling North on Johnson Avenue. After the crash the complainant reported vehicle 1 continued North on Johnson Avenue. A black bumper was laying on the ground on Johnson Avenue where the incident occurred. P.O. Dogali responded to assist. 8 photographs were taken of the incident with the backup patrol camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "On 01/01/2023, I was assigned to perform the alcotest on Mr. David Yumbla Inga, the arrestee.   P.O. Rios checked the arrestee's mouth for any foreign objects with negative results.  At 0430 hours, the minimum twenty minute observation period began.  During this time, the arrestee did not belch, cough, or have any bodily function that would compromise the alcotest.  At the completion of the 20 minute observation period, the arrestee was brought to the testing room.  All electronic equipment and contents within the arrestee's pockets were secured prior to entering the testing room.  I also secured my cellular phone  prior to entering the testing room. The room was clear of all electronic equipment (ie. cellular phones, portable radios). The arrestee was read the standard breath sample instructions.  A new mouthpiece was attached to the machine and a first breath sample was \nprovided, which yielded minimum volume not achieved, as the arrestee was sucking in, instead of blowing out.  The mouthpiece was changed and the instructions were again read and a second breath sample was provided which again yielded minimum volume not achieved.  Again the arrestee was sucking in instead of blowing out.  The mouthpiece was changed and the instructions were read again in English and Spanish (by P.O. Rios).  A third breath sample was provided which yielded Blowing not Allowed.  A fourth breath sample was provided by the arrestee.  Again the mouthpiece was changed and the instructions were read to the arrestee.  The fourth breath sample yielded Blowing not allowed.  A new mouthpiece was changed and a fifth breath sample was provided by the arrestee which yielded minimum volume not achieved. The arrestee was again read the instructions in Spanish and English.  A mouthpiece was changed and a sixth breath test was provided by the  arrestee which yielded a result of .15% BAC.  The mouthpiece was changed again and the arrestee provided his final breath sample which yielded a result of .15% BAC. After the testing was complete, the arrestee was turned over to Officer Rios.  The results were entered into the State of New Jersey Alcotest calculator which deemed the results were within acceptable tolerance.  A signed copy of the results were given to the arrestee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Last seen wearing long sleeve orange shirt, working beige pants and working brown boots. \n\n\n\n On September 16, 2024, I responded to Headquarters for a walk in on a report of a theft. Upon arrival, I met with the victim, Sung Park, who stated at approximately 1407 his puppy ran out of his business. The victim stated by the time he noticed his puppy unable to be found. The victim stated he reviewed the surveillance to his business and observed a white commercial van drive and unknown male suspect pick up the puppy and then proceeded to leave with the puppy. After reviewing the surveillance footage due to the quality, I was unable to determine the registration and the company name of the commercial van. The puppy was a brown and white Poodle mixed with a Pischon and is valued at $1500.00 dollars. It should be noted the puppy is 7 months and chipped. \n\n   The victim received a completed victim notification form. ",
